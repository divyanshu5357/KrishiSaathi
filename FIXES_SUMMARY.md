2. Run: `node server.js`
3. Open browser to: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
4. Create account and explore features

### Full Setup (With API Keys)
1. Get API keys:
   - OpenWeatherMap: https://openweathermap.org/api
   - Google Gemini: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

2. Edit `.env` file:
   ```env
   OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   ```

3. Start server: `node server.js`
4. Open: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

2. **SETUP.md** - Quick setup guide
3. **FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Application loads in browser
- ✅ Signup creates new user
- ✅ Login works with created account
- ✅ Dashboard displays all sections
- ✅ Navigation between sections works
- ✅ Equipment rental cards display
- ✅ Booking form works
- ✅ Market prices display (default data)
- ✅ Crop suggestions show based on location
- ✅ Language switcher works
- ✅ Sidebar menu opens and closes
- ✅ All icons render properly

## Known Limitations

1. **localStorage Security:** Data is stored in browser localStorage (not suitable for production)
2. **No Database:** All data is client-side only
3. **API Keys in .env:** Keys should use proper secrets management in production
4. **No Authentication Backend:** Login is purely client-side validation

## Recommendations for Production

1. Implement proper backend authentication with JWT
2. Use a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
3. Implement proper secrets management
4. Add input validation and sanitization
5. Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
6. Add comprehensive error logging
7. Use HTTPS for secure communication
8. Add user session management
9. Implement forgot password functionality
10. Add proper data backup mechanisms

## Conclusion

All critical errors have been fixed. The application now:
- Starts without errors
- Handles missing API keys gracefully
- Provides clear error messages
- Has comprehensive documentation
- Works for demo/testing purposes
- Is ready for further development

The app can be used immediately for testing and demonstration. For full functionality (weather and AI features), API keys need to be added to the .env file.
